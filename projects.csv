Number Guessing Game	2023-01-04	"In this project, you will build a console game that will let you exercise the skills and concepts you have learned in the unit so far. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game. You've likely played this game before! You'll ask a friend: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number. Usually, players will try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. This is often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses."
