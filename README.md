# project-5-portfolio-with-sqlalchemy

Create an interface for a portfolio web application. The main (index) page lists your projects including the project title and short description. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.

The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied for you.

## Instructions
### To run the project(s):
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the packages in the **requirements.txt** file
3. Use your favorite IDE or the console to run the app.py file.
